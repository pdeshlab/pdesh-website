Hi! I'm Pia Deshpande â€” a PhD Student in the [Travers Department of Political Science](https://polisci.berkeley.edu/) at UC Berkeley. I have a particular interest in how social media shapes American politics.

Prior to Berkeley, I was a pre-doctoral researcher at the Cooperative Election Study and a research assistant at the MIT Election Lab. I also worked as a data journalist for the Associated Press during the 2020 election, and interned at CNN Hong Kong and POLITICO. I hold a BA in Political Science from Columbia University.

You can contact me at `pia_deshpande@berkeley.edu`.
